<h3>Minimum and Maximum Grid Track Sizes</h3>

<section>
    <p>
        Tracks sizes can be defined to have a minimum and/or maximum size with the minmax() function.

        The minmax() function accepts 2 arguments: the first is the minimum size of the track and the second the maximum
        size. Alongside length values, the values can also be auto, which allows the track to grow/stretch based on the
        size of the content.

        In this example, the first row track is set to have a minimum height of 100px, but its maximum size of auto will
        allow the row track to grow it the content is taller than 100px.

        The first column track has a minimum size of auto, but its maximum size of 50% will prevent it from getting no
        wider than 50% of the grid container width.
